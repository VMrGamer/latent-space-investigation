 This is a repository for my Research Methodology Course Project on, Investigation of Latent Space in GAN

## Support

- Contact: [email me](v.mr.gamer@gmail.com)
- For issues, raise them on the GitHub itself or mail me on the above emaill

## Road-map

- Our current goal is to get the latent space of a Generative Adversarial Network
- We can expand the work to Autoencoders and Variational Autoencoders
- Ambitiously, expand the work to Transformer Networks and Manifold Learners
- Superficially, Work on expanding the project into a library of sorts

## Project Status

- The project is currently under development, and I'm working on making everything done until now on GANs more organized
- Feel free to contribute, generate Pull Requests or raise Issues, it is very much appreciated.
